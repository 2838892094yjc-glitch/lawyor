## What is Lawyor?

**Lawyor** is an AI-powered legal document IDE (Integrated Development Environment) built as a native plugin for **WPS Office** and **Microsoft Word**.

We bring the efficiency of modern code editors (like Cursor) into the legal domain — transforming how lawyers create, review, and format contracts.

## Core Features

- **Smart Templating (Hollow Out)** — AI automatically identifies variables (company names, amounts, dates) in contracts and converts them into structured, fillable forms with Content Controls.

- **Structured Drafting (Checklist & Skills)** — Senior lawyer expertise is distilled into executable Skills and Checklists. Toggle options to auto-insert or modify legal clauses.

- **AI Natural Language Formatting** — No more format menus. Just type: *"Title bold centered size 3, body Song Ti size 4, 1.5x line spacing"* — the AI handles the rest.

- **Clean Delivery** — One-click removal of all AI markers and hidden elements, producing a clean .docx ready for clients.

## Architecture Highlights

- **Dual-Platform Native Integration** — One codebase, works natively in both WPS Office and Microsoft Word.
- **Deep Document Control** — Real-time bidirectional binding between forms and document content via Content Controls.
- **Document as Database** — Form data stored in document properties. No cloud dependency. Fully offline-capable.
- **Multi-Model AI** — Hot-swappable AI backends (Kimi / Claude / DeepSeek). Local model support for sensitive contracts.
